# Sprite Sheets

Briefly:

- Each folder in this directory has a set of source sprite PNGs (usually 16x16 pixels) that are combined into
  output sprite sheets (see `source/assets/images/[folder].png`)
- If there is a `spriteDefaults.json` file in a folder, its properties will be inherited by each image in that path.
- Each output sprite sheet has a corresponding metadata file that describes where the source sprites are in the
  sheet. (see `source/assets/images/[folder].json`)
- You can override the cell size for sprites that are not 16x16 (see `./characters/spriteDefaults.json`)
- Player animations are expressed in the source directories as well (see `characters/magic/spriteDefaults.json`)

# License

Most of the source sprites are from the excellent E.B.U.R.P. game project:
