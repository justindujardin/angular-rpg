    //    the source, load sprite metadata files from disk, initialize the current map and cache it. This is
    //    relatively expensive, but we can show some cool "initializing game" distractions to make it fun.
    //  - "state update" is the fast load path for games that have been saved and are being resumed. The entirety
    //    of the game data is loaded directly from a serialized JSON blob. This should avoid a bunch of network
    //    requests, and hopefully bring the game back very quickly on load.

    // TODO: Should the app component be responsible for setting up notifications?
    // Maybe notification service should not need to be in the world, and should
    // use setTimeout rather than rAF updates.
