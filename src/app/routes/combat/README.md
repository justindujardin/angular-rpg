## Combat Simulation

The combat is turn-based and inspired by the original Final Fantasy game. It collects all player and enemy
moves, then executes them and repeats until someone has escaped, all enemies are defeated, or all party members
are defeated.

## State Machine Diagram

The basic logic for the combat simulation is expressed in the following diagram. This diagram excludes the details
of how player actions are chosen, and the effects of individual user actions during the simulation. Each of these
are worthy of their own discussion or diagram and are noted in green. Possible machine states are represented as
blue rectangles, and their possible transitions are noted by lines with arrows. Each state has a corresponding set
of files in the `./states/` folder.
